"""Pagination envelopes and PQL failure handling for Plane list endpoints.

Several resources list work items -- workitem, cycle and module -- and all of
them must return the same envelope shape and handle an invalid PQL filter the
same way. Keeping that here is what makes them consistent.

This is Plane's pagination contract, not one tool surface's: any surface talking
to these endpoints needs the same envelope and the same 400-on-bad-PQL answer.
