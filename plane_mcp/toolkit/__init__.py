"""Shared building blocks for Plane MCP tool surfaces.

These were previously underscore-prefixed modules inside `tools/`, where the
leading underscore was not a privacy marker at all -- it was the filter the
module-discovery loop used to tell helpers apart from resources. That made the
package's most widely used API (`spec`, imported by all 28 resource modules)
look private, and made the naming of an ordinary helper file load-bearing.

Nothing here knows which catalogue is calling it, so a resource package can be
renamed without these having to move with it.

The four modules split by *when* they act:

    spec        declaration time -- describe a resource's actions
    runtime     call time -- validate parameters, shape SDK payloads
    paging      response time -- Plane's pagination envelope and PQL failures
    governance  refusal time -- recognise a workspace-owned resource, read its flag
    transforms  listing time -- reshape the advertised catalogue

Names are re-exported here so a resource module needs one import, not four. The
submodules stay importable for callers that want to be explicit.
